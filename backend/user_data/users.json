Your low weight and height may also contribute to lower iron stores. \n  - Foods: Spinach, fortified cereals, pumpkin seeds\n  - Tip: Engage in regular exercise to improve circulation and boost energy levels.\n\n* VitaminB12: \n  - Why: As a young adult, a lack of VitaminB12 can cause fatigue. Your diet and age make you prone to this issue.\n  - Foods: Salmon, eggs, dairy products\n  - Tip: Establish a consistent sleep schedule to help regulate energy levels.\n\n* Magnesium: \n  - Why: Low magnesium levels can cause fatigue. Your age and sex do not provide any specific risks, but a lack of magnesium is common in general.\n  - Foods: Dark chocolate, almonds, brown rice\n  - Tip: Practice stress-reducing techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing.\n\n**Headaches:**\n\n* Magnesium: \n  - Why: A lack of magnesium can cause or exacerbate headaches. \n  - Foods: Dark chocolate, almonds, brown rice\n  - Tip: Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.\n\n* VitaminB2 (Riboflavin): \n  - Why: A lack of VitaminB2 can contribute to headaches. \n  - Foods: Almonds, milk, leafy greens\n  - Tip: Take regular breaks to stretch and move around, especially if you have a desk job.\n\n* Potassium: \n  - Why: A lack of potassium can cause or contribute to headaches. \n  - Foods: Bananas, avocados, sweet potatoes\n  - Tip: Limit caffeine intake, which can trigger or worsen headaches.\n\n[Urgency Note]: No urgent medical concerns were identified based on the provided information. However, if you experience severe or persistent symptoms, consider consulting a healthcare professional for personalized advice."
