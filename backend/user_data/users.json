          "analysis": "Based on your profile and symptoms, here is the analysis:\n\n**Zinc**:\n- Why: As an 18-year-old female, your body requires zinc for immune function and skin health. Acne can be a sign of a lack of zinc, which is essential for wound healing and inflammation regulation. \n- Foods: oysters, beef, chicken\n- Tip: Consider incorporating zinc-rich foods into your breakfast to boost your daily intake.\n\n**VitaminA**:\n- Why: Vitamin A is crucial for skin health, and its lack can lead to acne. As a young adult, your skin is still developing, and adequate Vitamin A intake can help regulate skin cell turnover.\n- Foods: sweet potatoes, carrots, dark leafy greens\n- Tip: Snack on Vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables to support your skin health.\n\n**VitaminE**:\n- Why: Vitamin E helps protect your skin from damage and supports skin health. A lack of Vitamin E can exacerbate acne. As a female, you may be more prone to Vitamin E deficiencies due to hormonal fluctuations.\n- Foods: almonds, sunflower seeds, spinach\n- Tip: Add a handful of nuts or seeds to your daily meals to increase your Vitamin E intake.\n\n**Urgency Note**: None flagged. However, if your acne persists or worsens, consider consulting a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying conditions."
