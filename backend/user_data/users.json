As a 26-year-old female, Feru's age and sex do not particularly affect her Vitamin A levels, but her Whole30 diet may be low in Vitamin A if she's not consuming enough animal products or sweet potatoes.\n- Foods: sweet potatoes, carrots, liver\n- Tip: Include Vitamin A-rich foods in your meals, especially at breakfast to help regulate skin cell turnover throughout the day.\n\n**VitaminD**:\n- Why: Low Vitamin D levels have been linked to acne, possibly due to its role in regulating immune responses and skin cell growth. As a 26-year-old female, Feru may be at risk for Vitamin D insufficiency due to limited sun exposure, especially during winter months. Her Whole30 diet may not provide enough Vitamin D if she's not consuming fatty fish or fortified foods.\n- Foods: fatty fish, fortified dairy, mushrooms\n- Tip: Spend some time outdoors during peak sun hours or consider a Vitamin D supplement, especially during winter.\n\n**Zinc**:\n- Why: Zinc plays a crucial role in wound healing, inflammation, and immune function, all of which are relevant to acne. Feru's Whole30 diet may be low in Zinc if she's not consuming enough oysters, meat, or poultry.\n- Foods: oysters, beef, chicken\n- Tip: Include Zinc-rich foods in your meals, and consider taking a Zinc supplement if you're not getting enough from your diet.\n\n**Urgency Note**: None flagged, but if acne persists or worsens, consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance.",
